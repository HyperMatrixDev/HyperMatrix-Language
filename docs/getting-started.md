## Using the `hmatrix` Command

The `hmatrix` command is the main way to execute HyperMatrix programs and access its interactive features. Below are the different ways to use it:

### **1. Run a File**
Execute a HyperMatrix file with or without arguments:
```bash
hmatrix <path-to-file> <args>
```
**Example**:
```bash
hmatrix hello-world.hm
```

### **2. Interactive Mode**
Start an interactive session to experiment with code:
```bash
hmatrix
```
This opens an empty interactive session where you can:
- Define variables.
- Execute code snippets.
- Test small programs.

### **3. Continue Mode**
Run a file and stay in interactive mode after it finishes execution:
```bash
hmatrix -continue <path-to-file>
```
While in continue mode, you can:
- Access variables defined in the file.
- Execute additional code.
- Run other files using the `run` command.

**Example**:
```bash
hmatrix -continue demo-file.hm
```

After the file executes, you can:
```bash
> println(myVar); // Access a variable defined in the file
> run another-file.hm; // Run another file
```

---

### **4. Setup a Project**
Initialize a new HyperMatrix project in the current or specified directory:
```bash
hmatrix -setup
hmatrix -setup:<path>
```
This creates a project structure and exits after setup is complete.

**Example**:
```bash
hmatrix -setup:/path/to/project
```

---

### **5. Attach a Library Folder**
Attach a library folder for the current run:
```bash
hmatrix -lib:<path> <file>
```
**Example**:
```bash
hmatrix -lib:/path/to/lib hello-world.hm
```

---

### **6. Attach Settings or Resources**

#### Settings
Attach a settings file for the current run (requires lexer updates for full functionality):
```bash
hmatrix -settings:<path> <file>
```

#### Resources
Attach resource files for the current run:
```bash
hmatrix -resource:<path> <file>
```
**Example**:
```bash
hmatrix -resource:/path/to/resources hello-world.hm
```

---

### **7. Display Grammar Documentation**
Use the `-help` flag to display grammar documentation in Markdown format and exit:
```bash
hmatrix -help
```

---

## Writing Your First Program

1. Create a file named `hello-world.hm`:
   ```hm
   println("Hello, World!");
   ```

2. Run the file using the `hmatrix` command:
   ```bash
   hmatrix hello-world.hm
   ```

3. Expected output:
   ```
   Hello, World!
   ```

---

## Exploring Examples

HyperMatrix comes with several example programs to demonstrate its features. You can find them in the `examples/` directory:

- **`hello-world.hm`**: A basic Hello World program.
- **`paint-heart.hm`**: Drawing a heart in Windows 11 Paint.

Run these examples using:
```bash
hmatrix <path-to-example>
```
